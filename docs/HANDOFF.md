# LDRGLPRx — Handoff (Current State)

## Project
GLP-1 weight loss telehealth marketing site (modeled after medvi.org). Static HTML, no build step.

- **Working dir:** `/Users/thomasmundheim/Desktop/Development/LDRGLPRx/`
- **Git remote:** `github.com/TJMundheim/LDRGLPRx` (branch: `main`, in sync with origin)
- **Intended domain:** `ldrglprx.com` (NOT YET REGISTERED — user plans to buy)
- **Local preview:** `python3 -m http.server 8000` from the project root

## AWS
- `aws-cli/2.34.32` installed via pkg installer
- `~/.aws/credentials` + `~/.aws/config` configured
- IAM user: `tmundheim`, account `879696522760`, region `us-east-2`
- Output format: not set (defaults to json)
- **No AWS resources created yet** — deployment is pending domain purchase

## Planned deployment (not built)
- Target bucket name: `website-ldrglprx`
- Deployment must be via a single `deploy.sh` script (no CloudFormation, no direct CLI)
- Script should handle both infra bootstrap AND content sync (detect & create missing)
- HTTPS via CloudFront + ACM (us-east-1 cert), custom domain to be attached after purchase
- `deploy.sh` has NOT been written yet

## File inventory
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Landing page — hero, treatments, about GLP-1, how it works, FAQ, intake form |
| `about.html` | Our Story, Values, Medical Team, Pharmacy Partners, stats, FAQ |
| `blog.html` | 3 full articles on a single page (TLDR + rich content each) — SEE "Pending Split" below |
| `bmi-calculator.html` | Interactive BMI tool + GLP-1 eligibility indicator, FAQ |
| `contact.html` | Contact cards, form, emergency notice, FAQ |
| `referral.html` | Give $50 / Get $50 referral program, FAQ |
| `links.html` | Linktree-style link hub |
| `privacy.html`, `terms.html`, `consent.html` | Legal pages |
| `404.html` | 404 page (noindex) |
| `cookie-banner.js` | Cookie consent banner |
| `robots.txt` | Permissive, points to sitemap.xml |
| `sitemap.xml` | 10 URLs, lastmod `2026-04-18` |
| `images/` | Static images (og-image.jpg, hero.jpg, etc.) |

## SEO / AEO state (just completed)
Every indexed page has full JSON-LD structured data:

| Page | Schemas present |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Organization, WebSite, MedicalBusiness (3 services), WebPage, BreadcrumbList, **FAQPage (8 Q)** |
| `blog.html` | Organization, WebSite, Blog, BreadcrumbList, 3× MedicalWebPage, **FAQPage (6 Q)** |
| `about.html` | Organization (with knowsAbout), AboutPage, BreadcrumbList, **FAQPage (5 Q)** — visible FAQ section added |
| `bmi-calculator.html` | Organization, WebApplication (with AggregateRating), MedicalWebPage, HowTo (5 steps), BreadcrumbList, **FAQPage (6 Q)** — visible FAQ section added |
| `referral.html` | Organization, WebPage, BreadcrumbList, **FAQPage (4 Q)** |
| `contact.html` | Organization (3 ContactPoints with hours), ContactPage, BreadcrumbList, **FAQPage (4 Q)** — visible FAQ section added |
| `privacy.html` | Organization, PrivacyPolicy, BreadcrumbList |
| `terms.html` | Organization, TermsOfService, BreadcrumbList |
| `consent.html` | Organization, MedicalWebPage, BreadcrumbList |
| `links.html` | Organization, CollectionPage, BreadcrumbList |
| `404.html` | None (noindex) |

**TLDR blocks:** visible `<aside class="tldr-box">` at top of each of the 3 blog articles with summary paragraph + 6 bullet points. AEO-optimized for LLM extraction.

**Sitemap:** bumped all `lastmod` to `2026-04-18`, added `links.html`.

**llms.txt:** intentionally NOT added — user doesn't want one.

## Pending / open work

### 1. Blog split (DONE)
- `blog.html` rewritten as listing page (3 cards with full TLDR + "Read full article →"). JSON-LD: Organization, WebSite, BreadcrumbList, Blog, ItemList. FAQPage moved to individual articles.
- `blog/article.css` — shared styles extracted.
- `blog/semaglutide-vs-tirzepatide.html`, `blog/what-to-expect-first-month-glp1.html`, `blog/am-i-eligible-for-glp1.html` — each standalone, own canonical + MedicalWebPage + BreadcrumbList + FAQPage (2 Qs each), related articles block.
- `sitemap.xml` updated with 3 new URLs.
- `robots.txt` updated with AEO bot allow-lines (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, etc).

### 2. Split other pages (USER-REQUESTED, UNDECIDED SCOPE)
User said "other pages need split outs too not just blogs." Candidates proposed:
- **Treatments split** (highest AEO value): `index.html#treatments` → `/treatments/semaglutide.html`, `/treatments/tirzepatide.html`, `/treatments/oral-glp1.html` — each drug gets its own rankable page
- **About split** (lower value): `about.html` → `/about/team.html`, `/about/pharmacy-partners.html`
- **Awaiting user confirmation** on which to do before implementing

### 3. Domain + deployment
- User needs to register `ldrglprx.com` first (registrar TBD — Route 53 is simplest)
- Then write `deploy.sh` (specs above under "Planned deployment")

### 4. Nice-to-haves (not requested, flag if relevant)
- robots.txt could add explicit allow lines for GPTBot/ClaudeBot/PerplexityBot (AEO)
- Open Graph images could be made page-specific (most pages share `images/og-image.jpg`)
